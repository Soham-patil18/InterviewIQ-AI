## 🔄 Complete User Workflow

1. **Resume** 📄 → Candidate uploads PDF resume. AI parses and extracts structured data.
2. **JD** 🎯 → Candidate pastes target Job Description.
3. **ATS** 📊 → AI performs a gap analysis, generating an ATS match score and improvement plan.
4. **Interview** 🗣️ → Candidate begins a strict technical interview customized to the JD.
5. **Coding** 💻 → Candidate solves algorithmic challenges in the live Monaco IDE.
6. **Reports** 📈 → Session ends; AI generates a comprehensive performance report.
7. **Career Readiness** 🎯 → Candidate checks the Hub to track long-term algorithmic and behavioral growth.
8. **Recruiter View** 👔 → Recruiter instantly exports a confidential "Hire/Reject" assessment PDF.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soham-patil18/InterviewIQ-AI.git
cd InterviewIQ-AI
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:

```env
# Database (PostgreSQL / Supabase)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"

# Supabase Auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-project-url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# AI Provider
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key"

# Code Execution
PISTON_URL="http://localhost:2000/api/v2/execute"
```

### 3. Database Setup

Generate the Prisma Client and apply database migrations:

```bash
npx prisma generate

# For local development:
npx prisma migrate dev

# For production deployment:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

*(Note: While `npx prisma db push` can be used for rapid local prototyping, `migrate` is recommended for managing state in this production-grade application).*

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Next.js development server with Turbopack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the platform.

## 🐳 Docker & Piston Setup

InterviewIQ AI uses [Piston](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston) to securely execute untrusted user code. To run this locally:

```bash
# Pull and run the Piston Docker image on port 2000
docker run -d -p 2000:2000 ghcr.io/engineer-man/piston
```

## ☁️ Deployment

- **Vercel**: The application is highly optimized for Vercel. Connect your repository and it will automatically detect the Next.js framework.
- **Supabase**: Set up a Supabase project for managed PostgreSQL and Auth. Update your Vercel environment variables with the provided connection strings.
- **Docker**: The Piston execution engine must be deployed on a VPS (like DigitalOcean or AWS EC2) as it requires a persistent Docker daemon.

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Data Fetching**: Heavy Dashboard and Recruiter queries utilize staggered `Promise.all` batches to prevent connection pool exhaustion.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Large libraries (like Recharts) are aggressively lazy-loaded using `next/dynamic` to shrink initial JavaScript payloads.
- **Strict Connection Pooling**: Prisma PostgreSQL pools are highly clamped to survive aggressive Next.js isolate spawning during hot-reloads.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Strict Security Headers**: Denies iframe embedding (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`), forces strict origin referrer policies, and enforces HSTS.
- **Centralized Auth Utilities**: API routes are protected by shared `requireUser()` wrappers that instantly terminate unauthenticated requests.
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Candidate code is never evaluated on the host server; it is shipped to isolated, ephemeral Docker containers via Piston.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

- [ ] Voice-to-Text integration for mock behavioral interviews.
- [ ] Enterprise SAML/SSO login for corporate recruiting teams.
- [ ] Real-time multiplayer collaborative coding sessions.
